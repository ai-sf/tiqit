intro: "The University of Trento is a young, medium-sized university in a friendly city, that offers an excellent quality of life. The new Department of Physics was established in 2012. This step was the natural continuation after nearly 40 years, during which its researchers had been engaged in many key sectors. The University will host talks focused on the research performed in Trento in the field of Bose-Einstein condensation and Nanoscience, after the talk the there will be a visit to the laboratories.

The Innsbruck Physics Research Center is committed to carry out excellent, worldwide competitive research addressing a broad range of modern topics in physics. The Center is organized along three main research areas: Astro- and Astroparticle Physics, Ion- and Applied Physics, and Quantum Physics. The Center is strongly linked to many research institutions worldwide and provides a truly international environment for researchers from all over the world.

The Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences dedicates its work to theoretical and experimental basic research in the areas of quantum optics and quantum information science. Research topics range from the foundations of quantum physics to their applications, for example for metrology, sensor technology and quantum information processing. Internationality, worldwide networking and highly actual research topics characterize the institute's work which aims at conducting independent top-notch research. The institute's personnel and infrastructure is closely connected with the University of Innsbruck and contributes strongly to the education of doctoral and master students. A particular concern of the institute is the sustainable advancement of young academics, and together with the University of Innsbruck, their integration into the research and teaching program."
